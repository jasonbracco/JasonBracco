Hi, I'm Jason!  I'm a curious, project driven, full stack software engineer.  Based in New York City, I'm constantly moving (more often than not with my dog, Beau) and finding new inspirations, usually centered around fashion and food.  

I am taking that same curious energy and channeling it so I can bring some of my ideas to life though code.
